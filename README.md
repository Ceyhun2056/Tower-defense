## Tower Defense

Implementation Progress: **Phases 1-6 Complete + Polish Update**

**Recent Improvements (Pre-Phase 7):**
- **Fixed Projectile Targeting**: Implemented predictive targeting system - projectiles now lead moving enemies
- **Enhanced Collision Detection**: More forgiving hit detection with larger collision radius
- **Major CSS Overhaul**: Modern gradient-based design with GitHub-inspired dark theme
- **Visual Polish**: Improved tower, enemy, and projectile rendering with gradients, shadows, and highlights
- **Better Map Graphics**: Enhanced terrain with texture details and improved visual depth

**Phase 1-2 (Complete):**
- HTML5 canvas, responsive HUD, Start/Pause/Restart buttons
- Modular JS architecture with game loop and fixed timestep
- 2D grid map with path/grass tiles and hover highlighting

**Phase 3 (Complete - Enemy Logic):**
- `Enemy` class with HP, speed, path following, and rendering
- Wave spawning system (enemies spawn every second in waves)
- Path following using waypoint navigation
- Game state integration: lives decrease when enemies reach base, money/score increase when defeated
- Enemy scaling: HP and money value increase with wave number

**Phase 4 (Complete - Tower Placement & Shooting):**
- `Tower` class with range, damage, and fire rate mechanics
- Click-to-place tower system with money deduction (50 gold per tower)
- Build validation: only on grass tiles, not on paths or existing towers
- Visual feedback: green highlight for buildable areas, red for invalid
- Automatic targeting: towers find and shoot nearest enemy in range
- Range visualization: hover over towers to see attack range

**Phase 5 (Complete - Projectile System):**
- `Projectile` class with physics-based movement and collision detection
- Animated golden bullets with trail effects and glow
- **Fixed**: Predictive targeting ensures projectiles hit moving enemies
- Collision detection between projectiles and enemies
- Visual cannon rotation to show tower targeting direction
- Projectile cleanup to prevent memory leaks

**Phase 6 (Complete - UI & Game State):**
- **Enhanced**: Modern, professional UI with gradient-based GitHub dark theme
- **Improved**: Comprehensive game screens with better visual hierarchy
- Pause system with dedicated pause overlay and game state preservation
- Real-time wave countdown and spawn progress indicators
- Tower affordability indicators with dynamic styling
- **Added**: Animations, better responsive design, and accessibility improvements

**Gameplay Features:**
- **Working Combat**: Projectiles now accurately hit moving enemies with predictive targeting
- **Professional Visuals**: Modern dark theme with gradients, shadows, and visual effects
- **Rich Tutorial**: Comprehensive instructions and smooth onboarding experience
- **Strategic Depth**: Range visualization, resource management, and progressive difficulty
- **Responsive Design**: Polished UI that works well on desktop and mobile devices

**Visual Improvements:**
- Gradient-based towers with rotating cannons and realistic shadows
- Enhanced enemies with health bars, gradients, and visual feedback
- Improved projectiles with glow effects and motion trails
- Better map terrain with texture details and depth
- Modern UI theme inspired by GitHub's design language

**Next Phases:**
- Phase 7: Multiple tower types (sniper, cannon, laser) and enemy variants
- Phase 8: Tower upgrades, special abilities, and advanced game mechanics
- Phase 9: Sound effects, particle systems, and visual polish
